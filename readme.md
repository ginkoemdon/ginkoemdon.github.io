ABOUT MY WEBSITE PORTFOLIO

I genuinely enjoyed designing and building this website. As a newbie bootstrapper, I am so thrilled at how much this adds to the efficiency of my front-end workflow! In these past 2 Semesters, I am grateful to have thoroughly learned from the foundations up and I'm really excited that this is only the beginning for me as a front-end web Designer. Im really grateful for Rob for being such a wonderful prof!

-------- How I Created my Portfolio: --------

Designing the Prototype
‣Designing this was a joy. It started within my UX Design course; our assignment was to design our own personal promotional website (aka a portfolio website). We began with writing up a creative brief, identifying things like our business and user goals, target market research, branding identity, personas etc. Then onto iteration, site-mapping, making a user-flow, low-fidelity sketching, wireframing, a low-fidelity digital prototyping, and then finally a high fidelity digital prototype on adobe XD. It was really stimulating to be designing with the intention of coding it myself. I wanted to design effectively, so I found an Adobe XD Bootstrap 5 UI kit, that helped me out a lot when composing the layout.

‣ There was a research aspect to this, gathering insight and inspo from designers on youtube, portfolio reviews, and looking at other designers portfolios; all which have used Content Management Systems, thus, it was unrealistic to hold mine to the same standard since I would be coding from scratch. However, there this stage I can get a bit too indulge in. Inspiration overwhelm is a thing!

‣ I gathered my assets such as: choosing my google font, colour palette & background gradient, images, icons, and favicon.

From Design -> HTML, Bootstrap, CSS
I created my Portfolio using Html, Bootstrap v5 beta, alongside custom CSS styling. I started by creating the skeleton structure of my HTML content with the necessary bootstrap components; section by section as a rough layout. From there, I started going back; making the incremental changes such as the spacing, font scaling, and responsive layout maneuvering to match closer and closer to the visuals of my mockup. I found that CSS becomes a great side-kick alongside the bootstrap styling. The CSS

‣ A challenge I faced was adjusting my colour pallet to meet the WCAG standard. I used an online tool called "Color Review '' to test out my font colours with the background colours to make sure I was up to contrasting standard. Another challenge that came up was creating my own custom colour theme for bootstrap to override the default colours. However, once I looked into it, It seemed too complicated and out of my scope considering it was to do with the scss file, which I have not learned about yet. But I was able to override the colours simply in css.

Why are colours the greatest joy AND the greatest challenge!?

Overall, I enjoyed the intimidating challenge of creating my first website portfolio. I definitely consider this to be a starting point in the long road of building and iteration of cultivating my professional industry portfolio. I learned that my big vision of what I want can interfere with the steps and time that is available to me now. So I learned to put that big vision aside, so I can present with the process.

I'm grateful for the challenge and excited to build more from here!
